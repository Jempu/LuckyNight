Ikatyros, or its representatives ("we", "us", "our") have given this license's
attainer or anyone working under this license ("you", "your") the rights to use
our digital assets or software under this license ("assets", "materials",
"software") in your work ("projects") without any worries for copyright under
these conditions:

THE ASSETS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ON INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE

ASSETS.

You have the rights to deal in the Software without restriction, including
without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
and/or sell.

Sublicensing is prohibited. You cannot change the type of license with assets
under this license and have to keep this license under the assets.

But first, let's define a few things:

Commercial - Projects are considered commercial if they generate
income, or advertises or links to promote any product. Links to a
user's profile are NOT considered as commercial.

If you are using our assets under a non-commercialized project,
you may use any assets under this license for free. However, you cannot
claim to be the creator or the provider for our assets.
Giving us proper credit is appreciated but not mandatory.

If you plan on generating revenue with a project that includes
any of our assets, you need to request our written permission that
you need in your posession if it's ever requested.

By default in commercialized projects, you have to mention us in
the project's credits and you have to pay us 35 percent of the profits
our assets are generating and you cannot claim to be the creator
or the provider of our assets. These can be different in the case those have
been agreed on.
